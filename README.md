Programm for a RaspberryPi to calculate the (x, y, z) position of an object from the pictures of two webcams.
With two stepper motors and a laser you will be able to track the object with the programm. The webinterface allows you to see the coordinates and to select the object.

The programm is commented in English, but the documentation of the project is in German.
