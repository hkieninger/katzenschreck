this programm was written for a RaspberryPi 3
it can also be run on a normal linux computer, but the  part for the following of the object should be removed

the programm requires a webserver installed on the pc
with cgi enabled in the directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ (default location)
an other directory can also be chosen, but then the Makefile must be modified

the directory for the webpages must be /var/www/html/ (default location)
an other directory can also be chosen, but then the Makefile must be modified

instruction to install apache2 and enable cgi can be found here:
https://code-maven.com/set-up-cgi-with-apache

furthermore the programm requires libjpeg und wiringPi installed
on debian based system, such as the rpi, this can be done with the following command
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

the webcam should be able to deliver the pictures in the yuv 4:2:2 (ycbcr) format (what most webcams do)
the programm uses a resolution of 640x480, higher resolutions could also be used for higher precision, but then some constants must be modified

the entire programm is written by me, except the library for the base64 encoding and the library for cgi
for their licenses please check the source-files
